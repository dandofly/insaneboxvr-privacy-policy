1. Introduction
Welcome to InSaneBoxVR!
We value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how InSaneBoxVR ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you play our VR game on Meta Quest devices.

2. What Information We Collect
We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII).

Our game operates entirely locally on your device. However, certain non-personal information may be processed temporarily for gameplay purposes, such as:

Headset and controller input (for hand tracking and interaction)

Device type and version (for performance optimization)

In-game physics, collisions, and animations

This information is not transmitted, stored, or shared externally.

3. How We Use This Data
All data mentioned above is used only for gameplay functionality, such as moving, grabbing objects, and interacting with the VR environment.

We do not use this data for analytics, marketing, or any other third-party purpose.

4. Children’s Privacy
InSaneBoxVR is not intended for children under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly collect data from children.

5. Third-Party Services
InSaneBoxVR does not use any third-party services such as analytics, advertising networks, cloud storage, or social media integrations.

6. Data Security
Your data stays on your device.
We do not store or transmit data to any external servers. All local device data is managed and secured by your VR headset’s operating system.

7. Your Rights
Since we do not collect or store personal data, no user data rights (like deletion or export requests) apply at this time. If that changes, we will update this policy accordingly.

8. Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
Changes will be reflected in this document and, if required, notified through the game or app store page.
